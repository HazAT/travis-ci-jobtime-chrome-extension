# Travis CI - Chrome Extension displaying average job time

This is a super simple Travis CI chrome extension that adds the average job time below each job on travis-ci.com / travis-ci.org.

### Example

### Motivation

I run a lot of travis jobs and wait for CI to finish. I happen to find myself clicking on older jobs just to see how long they ran.  
When I get annoyed by doing something repetive too often, I tend to automate it. That's why I quickly hacked together this extension.

Will it work for everyone, no.  
Is it helpful for everyone, no.  
But it solves my problem :)

There are a few things to make it work on private repos, right now it only supports open source repos.

### Installation

You can clone this repo and load an unpacked extension in chrome directly or load it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/travis-ci-average-job-tim/alognbjngjdljidhfffkgdpgocjcddei)
